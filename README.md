Plagiarism Classifier 

Welcome to the Plagiarism Classifier, a machine learning-powered web application that detects whether a given text is written by a human or generated by AI. This project combines the power of transformers, FastAPI, and a user-friendly HTML interface to deliver accurate predictions with confidence scores.

***Features***
Human vs AI Classification: Determines whether the input text is human-written or AI-generated.
Confidence Score: Provides a confidence percentage for each prediction.
Interactive Web Interface: Paste your text and get instant results.
Custom Fine-Tuned Model: Uses a fine-tuned transformer model for high accuracy.
Cross-Origin Support: Fully compatible with modern web browsers.
***Technologies Used***
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: FastAPI
Machine Learning: Hugging Face Transformers (BERT-based model)
Deployment: Uvicorn (ASGI server)
Data Augmentation: NLTK for text preprocessing and augmentation
Model Training: Hugging Face Trainer API and Scikit-learn
ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
****How to Run the Project****
1. Clone the Repository
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install the required libraries:

3. Start the Backend Server
Run the FastAPI backend:

The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

4. Open the Frontend
Open index.html in your browser. Paste your text into the input box and click Analyze to see the results.

*** Model Training***
The model was fine-tuned on a custom dataset using the Hugging Face Trainer API. Key steps include:

Data Preprocessing: Tokenization and truncation to 512 tokens.

Fine-Tuning: Using a pre-trained BERT model (bert-tiny) for binary classification.

Evaluation: Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
****Evaluation Results****
Metric	Value
Accuracy	95.2%
Precision	94.8%
Recall	95.6%
F1 Score	95.2%
****Key Highlights****
Custom Fine-Tuning: The model was trained on a balanced dataset with data augmentation for better generalization.
Real-Time Predictions: The backend processes requests in real-time, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Scalable Design: The project is modular and can be extended with additional features like multi-class classification or deployment to cloud platforms.
